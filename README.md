# Get away from your girlfriend and her shoe

Really stupid terminal game I made while I was learning about the A* algo. AI NCP uses A* to track you and come at you.

Just run get_away.py with python 3 to start the game.

It's a little buggy. Around the borders. I'll try to make is less buggy, later.
